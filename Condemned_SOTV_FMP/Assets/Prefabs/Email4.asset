  emailMessage: "That ID badge makes you feel a part of something bigger right? Giving
    you a purpose in capturing life at its fullest, like an impressionist depicting
    paintings as it is transformed relived moments of life itself. It makes your
    own perspective to every image you take in living your best memories. \r\n\nOnly
    that your moments in life aren\u2019t the same as others. Friends and family
    being the strongest of most people come across to you as the opposite. Are there
    worse than positive, captured moments in your scrapbook?  The realism of photography
    is making you realise that it is not all reliant and secure as it should be.
    Not only choosing this line of work as a career but being able to look back on
    something has been a struggle from the start.\n \r\nYou look at a polaroid and
    see disassociation from the world and feel purely isolated from it all, even
    though you feel it will all get better by further distraction. One of these methods
    being at the end of a bottle, that only delays and spirals the inevitable. Wouldn\u2019t
    you agree? \n\r\nOnly look no further than where you left your empty glass\u2026\r"
