  emailName: 'Acceptance:'
  emailMessage: "You did it! \n\nYou overcame the denial within yourself and have
    accepted you are suffering. It took a lot of strength to face your demons head
    on! This is the first major step to overcoming your depression. \n\nNow that
    you have the ability to be honest and speak out, the next step is to leave your
    apartment before the Veil consumes your thoughts once more! There is a lot to
    take away from all this, perhaps you can help other souls like yourself from
    being condemned to this horrible illness\u2026 "
