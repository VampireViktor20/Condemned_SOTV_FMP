  emailMessage: "Did you remember to take them? \n\n1 to 3 a day for the effects
    to gradually work the doctor said. It must be hard for you to reframe from taking
    more than prescribed or none at all. You said yourself that this was not going
    to be easy. Just think, once the routine of taking tablets becomes regular, you\u2019ll
    start to see a change in your emotions by sustaining some control and become
    stronger to deal with the mental problems affecting you. \r\n\nThis does not
    mean to say you have come out of denial. That something only YOU and you alone
    can decide. Do not think that this medication will hide the truth in what you
    are feeling. You might tell yourself that you feel better, and you can move forward
    without further need of support. In order to bring your denial to a close, you
    should reflect back upon the visions you were having and each photo you have
    captured to reach this point. \r\n\nWhy don\u2019t you head over to the mirror
    and take a long hard look at yourself and find closure\u2026\r"
