  emailMessage: "How's your head that morning? That\u2019s if you can even remember
    opening the bottle. It seems you\u2019ve found a distraction to block out all
    the memories you\u2019ve uncovered so far. Everyone likes a drink to relax and
    enjoy the company but who is around you to share that fun experience? You think
    that this will be easy to overcome and just forget with the affliction of alcohol?
    There is no escape from your own problems. \r\n\nYou can only go so far until
    it will cause yourself a mental collapse and nothing, but the past will cause
    you further pain. Dulling pain doesn't  heal and fade, it only prevents a period
    where you feel like yourself, only you\u2019ve not given the chance to feel normal
    because of everything you have gone through, with no way to healthily process
    from it. \r\n\nAre the visions starting to become clearer? This is what you have
    been trying to tell yourself from the start. Deep down you are suffering with
    the events from the past and facing constant denial by discarding it with alcohol,
    which is only concealing true feelings and dismissing the chance to be open about
    your emotions. How long can you cope with these defence mechanisms until you
    become fully condemned?\r\n\nIt\u2019s time to look for some guidance for healthier
    control. Remember what you stuck on the fridge...\r"
