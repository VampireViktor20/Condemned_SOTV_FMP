  emailMessage: "You found it! Remember when Debbie made it for you? That bond you
    shared was so strong. You could feel like you like you could to her about anything,
    day or night never mattered as she was there! \n\r\nThat all changed when the
    exam period took over your socialising as studying became your main priority.
    Debbie was still around at school but all the focus on revision started to bend
    your friendship, becoming isolated without having time to relax and have the
    closest person to you for support. Would things have been different if you made
    time back then and spoke to her more? \n\r\nOf course, that didn\u2019t mean
    to say your parents weren\u2019t there for you right? There was always that photo
    you kept reminding you of family memories\u2026\r"
