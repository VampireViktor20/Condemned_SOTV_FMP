  emailMessage: "Fond memories coming back to you? Your Mum and Dad had been planning
    this special holiday to celebrate your results and getting a place on your dream
    Photography course! It was all so perfect, wasn\u2019t it? Remember the last
    couple of nights seeing your parents so content and happy knowing their little
    girl was going to make something of herself. \r\n\nThis wasn\u2019t how things
    stayed when you set off for your university though. First the weekly catch ups
    settling on campus made you feel like you never left home. Mum more than dad
    at times to talk about the wonders of independence and studying your dreams.
    \r\n\nThis started to unfold when you found out that dad was let go from his
    work and Mum was having to pick up extra hours working at the office with the
    project manager. Weekly calls turned to every month or so with more bearing news
    to hear from Dad\u2019s voice, that Mum isn\u2019t welcome home anymore. How
    did that make you feel knowing that your role models are no longer together?\r\n\nCould
    you even call it a family anymore? You were so caught up in your studies that
    there wasn\u2019t time to process your parents\u2019 domestics. Was this a good
    distraction or do you think you should have been there for the two people who
    have supported you the most in your life? How could you after enrolling into
    a work placement. Don\u2019t forget your badge\u2026\r"
