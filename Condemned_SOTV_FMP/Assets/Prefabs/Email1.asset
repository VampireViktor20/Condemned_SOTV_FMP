  emailMessage: "So, the same visions you appear when you try to clear your head?
    \r\n\nI guessed as much. This isn\u2019t something that you can just \u2018sleep
    off\u2019 and get better. It all seems so real, doesn\u2019t it? Like someone
    trying to reach out and show the importance of it all. \r\n\nNow is the time
    to recollect the stages scattered around your life and piece together how you
    came to this point! I reckon your camera will help you capture the reality of
    it all.\r\n\nWhy don\u2019t we start at the beginning with something that symbolises
    friendship\u2026 \r"
