  emailMessage: "How did the meeting go? Did it feel better being able to talk to
    someone instead of keeping it all built up and causing further harm? It must
    have taken a lot of confidence to do that! Just know that you\u2019ll be better
    off from, it even though at this point you don\u2019t feel you\u2019ve physically
    got anywhere with moving forward. \r\n\nJust know that things will get better
    in time, just following the correct guidance and you\u2019ll look back and think
    why didn\u2019t I just speak up and ask for help? Of course, you\u2019re not
    out of the woods yet. The focus is to look after your mental health before rushing
    into anything else. Don\u2019t feel as if you need to put your life on hold.\n\nEven
    with the pressure of your studies, you need to take time for yourself and get
    back on track in being honest and speaking the truth in where you struggle most
    from unpleasant thoughts and potentially harmful urges. That prescription you
    picked up the other day should also help you\u2019re your moods and emotions.
    \r\n\nMight want to check if you have taken your dose today\u2026\r"
